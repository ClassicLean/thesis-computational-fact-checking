SOFT MARGIN: larger margin, more okay to violations.
HARD MARGIN: high C, smaller margin, but overfitted. (masikip)

WHAT IS A KERNEL?
A kernel is a mapping function which maps data into another higher dimensional space. 

KERNEL TRICK:

Kernel trick transforms the data by simply computing the inner products between all pairs of data in the feature space, thus eliminating the need to calculate the positions or coordinates of the data in the higher dimensional feature space.  Useful when transforming data to a very high dimensional space. It takes a lot of computational power.
