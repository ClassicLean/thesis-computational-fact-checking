At the time, such a concept was almost unheard of. Pinkerton said '' It is not the custom to employ women detectives! `` Kate argued her point of view eloquently - pointing out that women could be ''most useful in worming out secrets in many places which would be impossible for a male detective. `` A Woman would be able to befriend the wives and girlfriends of suspected criminals and gain their confidence.

He married Jane Cunningham, known as ``Jennie June'', in 1856. In 1863, during the Civil War, he co-authored the anonymous pamphlet Miscegenation, which tried to discredit the Abolitionist movement and the Lincoln Administration by playing on racist fears common among whites. The anonymous author of the pamphlet claimed to be an Abolitionist in favour of promoting the intermarriage of whites and blacks, a taboo practice that at the time was seen as a threat to white supremacy. The pamphlet coined the term miscegenation for the intermixing of races. From 1870 to 1873, Croly published a journal called Modern Thinker which served as a vehicle for the positivist and Spencerian positions of himself and a small circle of colleagues, including John Humphrey Noyes. In 1872, Croly predicted the Panic of 1873, along with the failures of Jay Cooke & Co. and the Northern Pacific Railroad.

Monge's murder victims were: his pregnant wife, Leonarda; Alan, age six; Vincent, age four; and Teresa, age eleven months. Immediately after the four murders, Monge called police and admitted his guilt. Monge had no prior felony convictions; in 1961, however, he abandoned his family for two months and served a short jail sentence in Louisiana for vagrancy. The alleged motive for the murders was ``to prevent exposure of sex crimes committed by defendant with his own children''. Monge beat his wife to death with a steel bar as she slept, stabbed Teresa, choked Vincent, and bludgeoned Alan with the steel bar."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"2050861176556883424","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17082466750572480596","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16651790297630307764","judgment":"no"}]}
